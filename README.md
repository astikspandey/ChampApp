# 📝 Patch Notes v0.1.0

## 🎉 First Official Update of ChampApp

This is the first official update of **ChampApp**.  
Nothing much to see here.

## 🛠️ What We've Been Up To

We have worked tirelessly for the past month trying to pull up a first official release, and now — **BAM! It's here**.

Though we experienced changing deadlines and difficulties, we finally pulled it off in **35 to 40 days**.
More Updates coming soon

## 🔭Sneak Peak to update v0.1.1

### Gui Changes
### Edited Functionality

And more!
Expected to release at 25th October, though beta version may come out in just a week in a specific subfolder, we'll drop the link here: NO LINK YET


By the way this is not our official code ofcourse, we wont publish our entire 2 dollar app open-sourced on github, this is just a simple demo file, our official proper site can be found here though it may be temporarily unavailabel till v1.0.0: https://maintanance.tiiny.site
